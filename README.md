MechaCar Statistical Analysis

Project Overview

The mpg dataset contains fuel economy data from the EPA for vehicles manufactured between 1999 and 2008. The mpg dataset is built into R and is used throughout R documentation due to its availability, diversity of variables, and overall cleanliness of data. For our purposes, we'll use the mpg data to demonstrate how to implement each of our ggplot visualizations.
